# fuzzy-sliding-mode-controller
codes for the four examples

Example_i_Open.mdl and Example_i_Closed.mdl are the simulink model files to simulate the time responses of the open-loop system and the closed-loop system in Example i, respectively, where i=1,2,3,4.

Example_i_Solve_Parameters.m is the code to solve the design parameters in the switching function in Example i, where i=1,2,3,4.

Example_2_Comparisons.m is the code to perform a comparisons among the linear switching function-based method, the PDC fuzzy switching function-based method, and the Non-PDC fuzzy switching function-based method from the viewpoint of the solvability of the sliding mode control problems.
